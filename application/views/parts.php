<h1>THIS IS PART PAGE</h1>

<div id="body">
	<p>THIS IS PART PAGE</p>
        <p>The parts page (for workers) should show all the parts currently on hand, ordered reasonably (piece type?) in a grid with images. 
            Show the model & line as either a tooltip for the image, or underneath each.

            Clicking on a part should show the complete data you have for that part, including CA, date made or acquired, etc. 
            This would suit a subcontoller and secondary page for just one piece.</p>
